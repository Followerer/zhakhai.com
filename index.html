                                    The road on which we walk, is not one paved in stone or brick. The path in which we
                                    choose to tread upon is one of sand and ash, the spots where we place our feet slide
                                    away as all abandon their past to make way for the future. Yet one can never abandon
                                    their past for it clings to them, no matter how far their journey may take them from
                                    it.<br><br>
                                    The bonds people find with those they care for, these are the bonds that bring them
                                    to be the strongest, and most vulnerable. When one is brought to the point where
                                    they find themselves caught between choosing for themselves or another, it is in
                                    their nature to give their own for someone else. Zhakhai gave unto his brother a
                                    second chance, for him to live Zhakhai's life instead of his own. Yet Zhakhai had to
                                    leave to see it to fruition. Thus he left behind the path he once knew.<br><br>
                                    The first thing he noticed when he left the Azim Steppe was not the civilized nature
                                    of other people, it was the sky above. The touch of Azim's heat upon Zhakhai's skin
                                    felt...detached. The sun left a scorch upon his skin, one of uncare and unwant. It
                                    was not a heat of scorn, or a heat of acceptance. The sun seemed to forget who it
                                    was outside the Steppe.<br><br>
                                    Yet throughout his travels, at night was where his spirit was shaken. In his exile
                                    he sought to find comfort in Nhaama, to feel the kiss of moonlight against his skin
                                    as he basked in the presence of the Dusk Mother. But when the silver light slid
                                    across his skin...it felt empty yet again. He was not watched by the Mother and
                                    Father above, Zhakhai was alone and away from his people.<br><br>
                                    So it was, that he began on the path of ash and sand.<br>

                                    Zhakhai is contracted by the Thalian Circle, a group of Sharlayan radicals who seek
                                    to contain artifacts and knowledge that were exposed when Idyllshire was abandoned.

                                    Zhakhai's eyes never seem to be able to focus properly, with his right eye always
                                    being more dilated than his left.

                                    He has trouble in formal or serious occasions, seeming to constantly forget any form
                                    of appropriate mannerisms or culture.

                                    Zhakhai has a fear of being tied down or captured in a sense, so he always wear
                                    loose torn clothing so that if someone grabs him, the clothing will tear before they
                                    can get a firm grip.

                                    ponytail with streaks of white whilst the rests simply points upwards. The line of
                                    his jaw runs smoothly upwards as his cheeks seem to be filled in well enough. His

                                    appears to be a spot of miscolored darkened flesh on his right palm. While his skin

                                    considerable mobility. The Two Handed Sword along his back appears to be one with
                                    numerous chips and cuts into it, the leather on the handle loose and almost entirely
                                    stripped off. The clothes he chooses to wear usually are no better than his armor,

                        <br>
                        <p>Hey! I'm completely new to Final Fantasy Roleplay in general, but not to Roleplay overall! I
                            enjoy working toward
                            roleplay with and through people by developing the characters of myself and others to end up
                            for
                            a better
                            experience down the line!</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Ultimately, you can't roleplay by yourself. It is necessary to have multiple people, and
                            because
                            of that key
                            factor of Roleplay, I want to try and provide as enjoyable an experience as possible to
                            everyone
                            I have the
                            wonderful chance of roleplaying with. I'm willing to go with anything that is proposed to
                            happen
                            to my
                            character, even if it is to involve a significant risk or stress in the roleplay setting
                            itself.
                            Walk Ups are
                            always incredibly enjoyable, and in case you have any questions, feel free to send me a
                            message
                            whenever! Thank
                            you, and have a wonderful day!</p>
